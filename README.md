PortfolioRemy
========================

This project is fully powered by Symfony 2.3


## My configurations :


* Xampp 1.8.3
* PHP 5.5.3
* Apache 2.4.4
* MySql 5.6.11

Do not forget to configure PHP on your computer.

To turn a Symfony2 project you must make the following changes in the php.ini file :

    [Date]
    date.timezone=Europe/Paris

    [intl]
    intl.error_level=E_WARNING
    extension=php_intl.dll


It should also download accelerator APC but currently not available for 5.5.3 version of PHP.
